/**
 * Epic calimero-network/core#3928, with buttons.
 *
 *   A client holding only an account root and a device key can: obtain a
 *   session against a node it is not the owner of, read a context it is a
 *   member of, and submit a delegated write — with no password anywhere in the
 *   flow.
 *
 * `apps/scaffolding-e2e/workflows/delegated-session.yml` in calimero-network/core
 * asserts exactly that in CI. This page is the same flow with a person driving
 * it, for the things a scenario cannot show: what the failures look like, how
 * far you get before the missing piece bites, and that the identity in the
 * address bar is one you minted yourself thirty seconds ago.
 *
 * It drives the **scaffolding-e2e contract** rather than shipping its own, so
 * `set`/`get` below are that app's methods and there is no `logic/` directory
 * beside this one. See the README.
 *
 * ## Why the write does not use the session token
 *
 * The clearest thing this page has to teach is that reads and writes are
 * authorised by different things. The session is a bearer token the node minted
 * for a device it authenticated; it permits reads. The write is authorised by a
 * *warrant* — the author's own signature over one context, one method and one
 * exact set of arguments — which the relay spends on their behalf. The relay
 * never gains the ability to write something the author did not sign.

        linking lives behind one. So the consent is collected where you are signed in, and what
