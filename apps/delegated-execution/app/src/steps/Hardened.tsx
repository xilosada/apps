/**
 * The same flow, with the account root outside the browser and the device key
 * unreadable by it.
 *
 * This is one side of the page's custody switch. The other side is the demo as
 * it shipped: an account root minted in the tab and kept in `localStorage`, next
 * to a device secret in the same place. Both of those files say, in as many
 * words, that a product must not do that. This module is the other half of the
 * sentence — the same four legs, with the two secrets removed:
 *
 * | | browser custody | here |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | account root | generated in the tab, kept in `localStorage` | never in the browser; a CLI holding it signs the certificate |
 * | device key | a hex secret in `localStorage` | a non-extractable `CryptoKey` in IndexedDB |
 * | warrant, login statement | mero-js, from that hex secret | reproduced here against the key |
 *
 * Both paths are kept because the contrast is the subject. Deleting the
 * original would leave a page asserting that the compromise used to exist —
 * which is also why they are a toggle rather than two lists of steps: the
 * numbering would imply a sequence, and these are alternatives.
 *
 * ## What this still does not fix
 *
 * Script injected into this origin can *use* the key for as long as the page is
 * open — it can spend warrants and open sessions. That is the residual the
 * design accepts and cannot remove, because a key usable by the page is usable
 * by anything running as the page. What it removes is exfiltration: the
 * attacker cannot walk away with the identity, and revoking the device ends it.
 * A stolen hex secret, by contrast, is the account until the root revokes it.
