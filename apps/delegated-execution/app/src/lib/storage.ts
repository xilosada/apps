/**
 * What survives a page reload, and what deliberately does not.
 *
 * ## The root secret IS here, and it is the one compromise on this page
 *
 * The account root is the account, and mero-js says in as many words that in a
 * browser it does not belong in `localStorage`. This demo keeps it anyway,
 * inside the identity blob, because claiming an account with the cloud is a
 * *root* signature: without a stored root the button could be pressed exactly
 * once, before the first reload, and never again without re-entering 24 words.
 *
 * The trade is real and worth stating rather than hiding. A stolen device key
 * is revocable — that is what device certificates are for — and a stolen root
 * is the account, permanently. A product keeps the root in a desktop app, a
 * hardware key or an OS keychain and signs the challenge there; mero-js splits
 * `signAccountLogin` out from `signInWithAccount` precisely so it can. The
 * 24-word phrase shown once is still the backup.
 *
 * ## The claim is here too, because it is the thing that persists
 *
 * A routing proof is re-made on every read and nothing survives it. The
 * ownership claim is the opposite: it is proved once, the cloud records it, and
 * what this app stores is the receipt — which account was claimed, against
 * which cloud, and the session that came back. See {@link AccountClaim}.
 *
 * ## The device secret is here, also on purpose
 *
 * A device key is the thing a device holds — persisting it is what "reload the
 * page and you are still you" means, and it is the same trust boundary a native
 * app's keychain entry sits on. It is scoped to the origin, and revoking the
 * device is what recovers from losing the machine. A demo that re-minted a
 * device on every reload would be hiding the part worth showing: that a session
 * comes from a key you already had, not from a login you just performed.
 *
 * ## Nonces live next door
 *
 * mero-js's `createLocalStorageNonceSource` takes the key from its caller, so
 * {@link nonceStorageKey} is this app's choice and not an upstream constant.
 * Keying it by the device's public key is the part that matters: a counter
 * shared between two devices hands the same number to both, and the second
 * warrant is refused as a replay. Wiping the identity must wipe the counter
 * with it, which is what {@link clearStored} does — a surviving counter under a
 * regenerated device is the one combination that produces warrants the network
 * has already seen.
